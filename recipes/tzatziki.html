    <h1>Tzatziki recipe</h1>
    <img src="tzatziki-picutre.jpg" width="400" alt="a bowl of tzatziki">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tzatziki is made simply with yogurt, drained cucumber, olive oil, fresh herbs (usually mint or dill), garlic, lemon juice and salt. It's a refreshing chilled sauce, dip or spread.</p>

    <p>I traveled to Greece last fall and ordered tzatziki at every restaurant. I'm serious. I enjoyed tzatziki with every single meal, even breakfast. This recipe tastes just like authentic tzatziki.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One cucumber</li>
      <li>Greek yoghurt</li>
      <li>Few table spoons of olive oil</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
      <li>Vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start by grating the cucumber. </strong>I use the largest holes on a box grater to give my final sauce texture and plenty of green flecks. </li>
      <li><strong>Next, squeeze the water out of the grated cucumber.</strong> This step is essential for making a creamy tzatziki
        <ul>
            <li>if you skip it, the water from the cucumber will cause your sauce to separate. Squeeze the cucumber directly over the sink, or press it lightly between kitchen or paper towels.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Then, <strong>stir everything together!</strong> Mix the squeezed cucumber with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt, and herbs, and chill until you're ready to use.</li>


    </ol>
