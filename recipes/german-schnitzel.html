  <h3>Description</h3>
  <strong>Guten Tag!</strong> German Schnitzel is a quick and easy, yet elegant dish of crispy breaded pork cutlets that is perfect for a weeknight dinner or an Oktoberfest celebration! 
  <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>4 boneless pork chops</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2/3 cup breadcrumbs, unseasoned</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First, prepare your workstation by getting three large plates with higher sides. Put the flour on the first plate, crack the eggs and whisk them with a fork until uniform in color on the second plate, and add the breadcrumbs to the third plate
        <ul>
            <li>If there is excess fat on the meat, trim it.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Place one pork chop between two pieces of cling wrap (or put it in a freezer bag) and pound it with the flat side of a meat hammer until thin. You’ll be surprised how large relatively small pieces of meat can get. At the same time, be careful since you don’t want to pound holes into your meat</li>
    <li>Add salt and pepper to both sides of the pork chop, then set it aside. Pound and salt/pepper the rest of the meat.</li>
    <li>Take one piece of meat, place it onto the plate with the flour and press down slightly. Turn it over so that the other side also gets covered in some flour. Lift it up and place it on the plate with the whisked eggs. Again, flip it over so the other side gets covered as well. Lift the piece of meat, let the excess egg drip off, then transfer the piece of meat to the plate with the breadcrumbs. Press down slightly, then turn it over and press down again. Make sure the whole piece of meat is covered in breadcrumbs. Then set the breaded meat aside onto another plate. Repeat the flour-egg-breadcrumbs process with the rest of the meat.</li>
    <li>Heat oil, lard, or shortening in a large frying pan. Once the oil is hot enough (test this by placing a wooden spoon into the oil – if there are small bubbles forming around the spoon, it is hot enough), place the pieces of meat into the pan. Depending on the size of your pan and your meat, you might have to do this in two or more rounds. Fry the meat on medium heat for around 3-4 minutes, then carefully flip it over without breaking the breadcrumb coating. We use a flipper but you can use tongs if you are careful. Fry for another 3-4 minutes until fully cooked. Then transfer the Schnitzel to a plate.</li>
    <li>Serve the Schnitzel with some pieces of lemon. Popular side dishes are classic French fries, German fried potatoes, or potato salad.</li>
